# Skin Disease Identification with Image Processing and Machine Learning

This repository contains the code and models for a project that identifies skin diseases using image processing and machine learning techniques.

## Repository Structure

- Data Pre Processing: Notebooks for image preprocessing and data preparation.
- Training: Notebooks for training and evaluating machine learning models.
- api:
-       requirements.txt: List of required Python libraries.
-       main.py: Main script to run the API.
- saved_models: Trained machine learning models.

## Running the API

Set up the environment:
Create a virtual environment (recommended).
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the API:
Navigate to the api directory: cd api
Execute the main script: python main.py

## Additional Information

Data Pre Processing and Training: Explore the notebooks for in-depth details on data preparation and model training.
Model API: The API allows for integrating model predictions into other applications.
Saved Models: Use these to directly make predictions without retraining.
